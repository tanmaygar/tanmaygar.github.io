I am serving as a Teaching Assistant for the *Tensors: Techniques, Algorithms, and Applications* course, under the guidance of [Dr. Rameshwar Pratap](https://sites.google.com/site/prataprameshwaryadav/home). Apart from the regular TA duties such as creating and grading assignments and exams, I also offer one-on-one support to students and help them understand the concepts better.


<!-- This wasn't just a standard course; it was uniquely structured around open-ended research projects. My role involved mentoring diverse groups of students, guiding them through the difficulties of their individual projects. My commitment ensured that they navigated the challenges of their research with clarity, ultimately fostering innovation and deeper understanding of the subject. -->
