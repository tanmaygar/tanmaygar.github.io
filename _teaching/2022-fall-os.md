I have served as a Teaching Assistant for the Operating Systems course, taught by [Dr. Sathya Peri](https://people.iith.ac.in/sathya_p/). My responsibilities extended beyond traditional instructional duties; I offered one-on-one support to students, ensuring they understood the concepts with clarity and confidence. Additionally, I assisted in the evaluation by grading the assignments and examinations.
